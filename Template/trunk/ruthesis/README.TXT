*****************PHD SPECIAL INSTRUCITONS ******************
Final Preparation for PhD Dissertations:
Always refer to the website in case details have changed

1. Send PDF to Administrative person (Sigrún)

2. Get signature pages signed, and scan them into PDF

3. Go to Háskólaprent (on Suðurgata, see
http://ja.is/kort/#q=index_id%3A1408859&x=356174&y=407197&z=9 and
www.haskolaprent.is) and talk to Björgvin with the signature pages.

4. You need to enter the title, your name, and month/year into a
special PDF template for the printing of the cover and keel (I attach
a copy of the form, but it is best to do the data entry at
Háskólaprent).

5. Then they will insert your signature pages into the PDF and start
the printing process; Björgvin knows which paper to use, usually
240x170mm (aka B5, Programme, or Book Economy).

6. Once the first copy is ready, you can come back to Háskólaprent and
double-check that everything is correct.

7. If it is indeed correct, then they'll print the number of copies
you need, either next or same day.

8. Finally bring the copies to head of graduate studies(Luca or
Hlynur), who should forward them as appropriate.
